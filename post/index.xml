      <description>I really, really like the PyMC3 package for proabilistic programming in Python. It seems to hit a sweet spot of allowing near endless customisation of bespoke Bayesian models, while maintaining relatively concise and readable syntax. It samples super fast, and the PyMC3 community are great.
The problem is that installing it successfully on Windows 10 can be a serious headache. There seems to be various issues successfully installing the g++ compiler and connecting it with Theano, and/or issues with multiprocessing making sampling incredibly slow (if it runs successfully at all) and limited to one core.</description>
